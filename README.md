# Creepy Hangman!

## Technologies used include HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and JQuery. A Browser game built as an exercise in DOM manipulation.  I used Jquery to target all the elements on the page so that the user can navigate the website based on their own input. 

### My only unsolved problem is that the game gets buggy after a user restarts a game without refreshing the browser.
