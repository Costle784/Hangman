# Creepy Hangman!

A Browser game built as an exercise in DOM manipulation.  I used Jquery to target all the elements on the page so that the user can navigate the website and play the game based on either their own custom input or have it generated by the app. 

Technologies used include HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and JQuery. 

My only unsolved problem is that the game gets buggy after a user restarts a game without refreshing the browser.
